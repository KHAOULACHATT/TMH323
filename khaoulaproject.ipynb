    "\n",
    "Within this project, I utilized my informations about the ML to conduct an in-depth analysis of a Disease Symptoms and Patient Profile Dataset. The dataset encompasses information regarding disease symptoms, denoting outcomes as either positive or negative. Additionally, it includes demographic details of patients, such as age and gender, along with their medical history, specifically chronic diseases. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective revolves around the \"outcome variable,\" which represents the test result of an unidentified outbreak. The outbreak is characterized by common symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing. The aim of the analysis is to gain comprehensive insights into the relevance of the test result (categorized as positive or negative) concerning both the patients medical history (captured in the Disease column) and demographic features (blood pressure or age).
